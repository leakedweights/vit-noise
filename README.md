# Noise Classification using Vision Transformers

This is a toy project for training a simple vision transformer for noise classification tasks.
In this repository there is:

- A dataset containing 50K 64x64 images of different noises (Gaussian, Poisson, Brownian, etc.)
- A naive implementation of the Vision Transformer using `JAX` and `Flax`
- Training code for the ViT
